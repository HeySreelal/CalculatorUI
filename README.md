# Calculator UI

A simple calculator UI inspired by [Daily UI post by @juliejamolo](https://www.instagram.com/p/CcFMbBHPb8T/) on Instagram.

Just thought why not making it into an app? So, just built it and here's the results:

</div>

## ✍️ Note

This is just a dummy project, I'm not going to be adding any more features. Anyway, feel free to check out the code and make your or implement more features.
